    <h1>ABOUT THE WORLD CUP</h1> <br>
    <p>
        The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. The 22nd FIFA World Cup is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022; it is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A] France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion,[2] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion,[3] and other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.

This tournament is set to be the last with 32 participating teams, with the field to increase to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] this World Cup is being held during November and December.[C] It is being played in a reduced timeframe of 29 days with 64 matches to be played in eight venues across five cities. The Qatar national football team entered the event automatically, their first World Cup, alongside 31 teams who were determined by the qualification process. Qatar lost all three group matches; they became the first hosts to lose every game, the earliest host nation eliminated,[6] and the second host (after South Africa in 2010) not to progress past the first stage.[7]

In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in eight round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play to decide which teams would participate in the final, which will be held on 18 December 2022 at Lusail Stadium, coinciding with Qatar's National Day.[8]

The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar has been a source of controversy[D] due to Qatar's treatment of migrant workers, women, and its position on LGBT rights as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. <br> <br>

Overview
The FIFA World Cup is a professional association football tournament held between national football teams.[17] Organised by FIFA, the tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[18] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[18] The tournament is contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[19] The defending champions are the French national football team, who defeated the Croatia national football team 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final.[20][21] The event is scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[22] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[23][24][25] Being held in Qatar, it is the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[26] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[27]

Schedule
Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[4][24][28] the 2022 World Cup is being played in November and December.[9][29] As a result, the World Cup is unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of domestic association football leagues, which start in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which have been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions have scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[30]

The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[31] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[32][33] The final will be played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Iconic Stadium.[34][31] <br> <br>

The matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[34]

Groups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium
Groups C, D, G, H: Lusail Iconic Stadium, Stadium 974, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium
FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[35][36] On 11 August, it was confirmed that Qatar vs Ecuador had been brought forward one day, now becoming the tournament's opening match, while Senegal vs Netherlands, which would have opened the tournament under the original schedule, had been reallocated to the freed-up timeslot.[37] <br> <br>


Prize money
In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team will receive $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool will be $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[38]

Rule changes
The tournament features new substitution rules whereby teams may make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[39][40][41] In addition, it is the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team is permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution does not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[42] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[43]

Host selection
Main articles: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids and Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid
The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[44] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[45][46] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[47]

After UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[48] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. The 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[49] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[50] The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having "high operational risk",[51] generated criticism from media commentators.[52] It has been criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals.[53
